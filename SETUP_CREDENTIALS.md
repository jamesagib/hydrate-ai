# iOS Credentials Setup for GitHub Actions

## Problem
Your GitHub Actions workflow is failing because iOS credentials aren't set up for non-interactive builds.

## Solution: Set Up Credentials Locally First

### Step 1: Run Local Build (Interactive)
```bash
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

This will:
- Prompt you to log into your Apple Developer account
- Set up distribution certificates
- Create provisioning profiles
- Store credentials in EAS

### Step 2: Verify Credentials
```bash
npx eas credentials
```

### Step 3: Test Non-Interactive Build
```bash
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production --non-interactive
```

If this works, your GitHub Actions will work too.

## Alternative: Use Xcode Build Instead

If you can't use EAS Build due to limits, modify your workflow to use Xcode directly:

```yaml
- name: ðŸ“± Build iOS with Xcode
  run: |
    npx expo run:ios --configuration Release
```

## Current Workflow Status
Your workflow is already configured for local builds (`--local` flag), which is correct for avoiding EAS Build limits.
