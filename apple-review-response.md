Dear Apple Review Team,

We have fixed a bug that was introduced in our recent update that caused the app to crash for new users.

ISSUE:
Our recent OTA update was incorrectly showing the "Create Account" screen to new users instead of the welcome screen, causing crashes.

SOLUTION:
We fixed the authentication flow so that new users properly see the welcome screen when they first open the app.

USER EXPERIENCE IMPACT:
- New users now see the correct welcome screen
- No more crashes from the recent OTA update
- All existing users maintain their account access

This fix ensures a smooth experience for both new and returning users.

Thank you for your review.

Best regards,
The Hydrate AI Team
